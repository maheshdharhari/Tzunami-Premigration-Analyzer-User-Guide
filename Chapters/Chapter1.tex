 \section{INTRODUCTION}
 Tzunami Pre-migration is an application that scans the contents of the different ECM systems and generates reports. It helps the user to identify the possible hurdles and errors so that they can make the necessary changes or fixes on their source documents before the SharePoint migration. With the help of this feature, Truncate and Illegal Character map, available in the system we can suggest the user to make the necessary changes in their source document. User can also load the generated report by making the Spec file to the exporter.
 \\
So, \appName enables us to identify possible bottlenecks in the migration process beforehand. This will help to cut delays and re-work during migration process. The generated reports give us insight into the system and get us pre informed which helps to keep in track with our migration goal and business plan.
